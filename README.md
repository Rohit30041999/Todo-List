Todo-list application

Description: This is a basic web based todo application that I built with the help of a python web-framework called flask and a database
             known as sqlite3. This application is just used for adding, updating or deleting tasks for a day or a week.

Requirements:

  1) Python3
  
  2) pip3 or pip
  
  Steps To run a flask app:
  
  1) virtual envirement required so that you can develop applications even if the versions are not matching
     install virtualenv from pip(Python package manager) i.e,
     $ pip install virtualenv
     
  2) Create a virutal envirment as follows
     $ virtualenv envirmentName
     
  3) Activate virtual envirment as follows
     $ envirmentName\Scripts\activate
     
  4) from pip install flask, flask-sqlalchemy(for database connection) as follows
     (envirmentName) $ pip install flask, flask-sqlalchemy
     
  5) After everything is successfull you can clone the Todo-List reposity and execute the following command
     $ python app.py (Server starts after executing this command)
